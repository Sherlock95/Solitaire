                Solitaire with Colors by Jarrett Locke
            </span>
            <span id='description'>
                This is a game of solitaire created but not finished. Each card has its own individual value and there is some logic to the main 7 rows of
                cards. Each card has its own color, but no card's color is unique. The draw deck can be cycled through, but you cannot select a card from
                the deck to play. The 4 finish stacks are there, but they are not outlined nor are they useable. The logic of "this is a 9" and "this is red"
                is there and finding out which suite it is in is possible, but you can't see them. Enjoy! :)
